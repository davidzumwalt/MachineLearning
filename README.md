# MachineLearning
The [Titanic Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) is an excellent example data set to practice machine learning and predictive analytical techniques. It contains partially incomplete, somewhat erroneous data which necessitates some tidying and cleaning, and lends itself to demonstrating the importance of feature engineering and cross-validation.

The first entry to this branch is my code, written in R, to make predictions regarding the survivability of passengers on the Titanic using multiple features, some of which were engineered from the data, including passenger Title, Age, Sex, and others.
